For this # sqlalchemy-challenge I used jupyter notebook to connect to a SQLite database and make tables into classes I could use to answer questions about precipitation in Hawaii. I used matplotlib to create a graph for inches of precipitation. I created a histogram with 12 months of temperature observation data. Then I was able to create a Flask API which inclues a homepage, precipitation page, stations page, tobs page and start and end pages. Thank you.
