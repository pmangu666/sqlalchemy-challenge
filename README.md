I redid this challenge to the best of my ability. I used the provided app.py file instead of creating my own this time. I used jupyter notebook for the first part of this module and used matplotlip to create visuals to show precipitation and temperature in hawaii. For the flask portion I used the appropriate libraries such as sqlalchemy and pandas and os. Thank you # sqlalchemy-challenge
